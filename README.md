# PRODIGY_DS_02

#### This is task 2 of Prodigy Infotech internship program
#### Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Netflix dataset from Kaggle.
#### Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves several key steps:

Data Collection: Gather the dataset you want to analyze, such as the Netflix dataset.

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values.
Deal with outliers.
Format data appropriately.
Remove duplicate records.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze variables individually (univariate analysis).
Explore relationships between variables (bivariate analysis).
Examine correlations and patterns (multivariate analysis).
Engineer new features if necessary.
Visualize the data to gain insights.
Identify Patterns and Trends: Look for insights in the data, such as differences in survival rates based on passenger demographics or ticket class.

Documentation and Reporting: Document steps taken, summarize findings, and communicate insights effectively.

Following these steps helps understand the dataset, identify patterns, and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.
